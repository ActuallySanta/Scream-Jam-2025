If you are reading this message, it means you have purchased our '2D Pixel Quest Vol.3: The UI/Gui'. 
The assets have been tested, but feel free to contact us if you encounter any issues or if you're 
unsure how to implement the animations.

Volume 3 can be used as a stand-alone or in conjunction with Volume 1, 2, 4, 5 and Volume 6.


It's not strictly necessary, but we would greatly appreciate it if you mentioned 'Barely Apes' in your project!
If it doesn't take too much of your time, you could also consider leaving feedback or a rating for this pack.

Thank you for choosing our work!
Happy developing!

Best regards,
The BARELY APES Team!
